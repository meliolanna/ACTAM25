    <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
      "BEAT THE BEAT" is a little game designed for an academic project by three students of Politecnico di Milano.
      The purpose of this game is to approach people to the rhythmic solfeggio in a simple and funny way.
      It has been created in a simple way, but it remains expandable to new difficulties and levels.
      Any suggestion?
