## Purpose of the project
BEAT THE BEAT is an online game to challenge your rhythmic abilities. 
Traditional music solfeggio is boring, isn't it? With its different levels of difficulty and its practice mode, this game wants to be a funnier tool to help you learn it. 
It is designed to be good for every user:
- for music *beginners*, BTB can be a funny and simple way to discover the rhythmic notation, getting more confident with the duration of the notes and their subdivision in the time flowing
- for *children*, our game can be a colorful and less boring way to practice rhythmic skills, learning better by imitation
- for *everyone* who wants to increase their tempo perception and ability to keep time and go on time, faster and faster, without neglecting a bit of fun
